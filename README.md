# Privacy-Source

With the rise in the number of both public and private camera-based image acquisition systems,
both mobile and CCTV, an increasingly key concern is privacy protection. This is since modern 
computer vision systems are capable of automatically tagging a wide number of human features 
(such as age, ethnicity, gender, emotion and even mental state) based on facial image data 
becoming very intrusive. 
 
The aim of this project is to generate privacy measures at source, by automatically detecting
and applying privacy protection to all facial features captured at source using a simple 
based computer vision system (raspberry pi), system must be capable of running in real-time. 
 
Two methods are proposed to solve this problem Haar-cascades and Histogram of Orient Gradient
detectors. The result is that the system ran in sudo real-time.  
 
Conclusion is that with further modifying and reach it might be possible to get it working 
in real-time using HOG detection
